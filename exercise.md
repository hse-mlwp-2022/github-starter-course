# HSE MLwP 2022 Homework 1

## Exercise 1
#### Goal:  Reflect on your goals for the semester
- Create a file named goals.md in your repository.
- Using [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), create headings for "My Experience" and "My Goals".
- Write one paragraph (1-5 sentances) about your previous programming experience.  Include a working link somewhere in the paragraph.
- Create a bulleted list of 2 or 3 goals for you to work towards during this course.  
- Create a bulleted list of 3-9 specific objectives for you to acheive during this course.  
- Remember to commit the file to your local respository and push it to your github, so it will be included in the pull request you create to submit your assignment.  
- Once you've pushed your code to GitHub, view a rendered version of your file on GitHub to make sure the formatting is as you intended.

## Exercise 2 (optional)
#### Goal:  Learn how to use git from console
- Clone your repository locally using `git clone` command from the terminal.
- Create a new file named ex2.md in your local copy of the repo.
- Add to that file your full name, name of the operating system you are using and current date and time, all separated by new lines.
- Do the `git add ex2.md` and `git commit` commands from the terminal.
- Type in commit message.
- Do the `git push` command from the terminal.


## Submit your repository
#### Goal:  Learn how to push your commits to GitHub and create a pull request on GitHub.com
Once you're ready to commit and push your responces, look at the notes from your teacher for instructions on commiting, pushing and submiting your work.
